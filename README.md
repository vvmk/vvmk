### **Note to future vince/disclaimer to anyone else:**
  
update.sh will only work if you have:

* write permission on the master branch of the containing repo
* the same (fairly vanilla) local file structure that it looks for. 

It is not intended for use by anyone other than myself and 
no guarantee is made that it will function properly for anyone. That said, feel
free to use whatever to your heart's content.
